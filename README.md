# Bertrand Competition Market Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a Bertrand competition between two companies, implementing a strategic pricing model based on microeconomic principles of market dynamics and strategic interaction.

## Scientific Background

### Bertrand Competition Model

The Bertrand competition model, first proposed by Joseph Bertrand in 1883, is a fundamental economic theory describing price competition between firms. Unlike Cournot competition, which focuses on quantity, Bertrand competition centers on price-setting strategies.

Key characteristics:
- Firms compete by simultaneously setting prices
- Consumers purchase from the lowest-price firm
- Firms aim to maximize profits through strategic pricing
- In perfect competition, prices converge to marginal cost

## Project Structure

### Class Breakdown

#### 1. `Market` (market.py)
Represents the market environment with key economic mechanisms:

**Attributes:**
- `market_size`: Total potential market volume
- `max_price`: Maximum sustainable price point
- `price_sensitivity`: Elasticity of demand relative to price differences

**Key Methods:**
- `market_share(price_a, price_b)`: Calculates market share using a logistic function
- `demand(price)`: Computes market demand based on price

**Scientific Mechanism:**
The market share is determined by a logistic function, which captures non-linear consumer behavior:
- Small price differences have minimal impact
- Significant price differences dramatically shift market share
- Ensures smooth transition between competing firms

#### 2. `Company` (company.py)
Represents individual market participants:

**Attributes:**
- `name`: Identifier for the company
- `cost`: Cost structure
- `price`: Current price setting

**Key Methods:**
- `set_price(price)`: Adjusts company's price
- `profit(quantity)`: Calculates profit based on price and quantity

**Profit Calculation:**
Î  = (p - c) * Q
- p: Price
- c: Marginal Cost
- Q: Quantity sold

#### 3. `Cost` (cost.py)
Manages cost structure:

**Attributes:**
- `marginal_cost`: Constant cost per unit produced

**Method:**
- `get_marginal_cost()`: Returns marginal cost

#### 4. `BertrandUnderbiddingStrategy` (strategy.py)
Implements pricing strategy with dynamic adjustment:

**Key Features:**
- Automatic price underbidding when at a competitive disadvantage
- Randomized underbidding to simulate market uncertainty
- Ensures prices never fall below marginal cost

**Strategy Mechanism:**
1. Compare own price with competitor's price
2. If higher, reduce price strategically
3. Use random factor to introduce market variability
4. Maintain a price floor at marginal cost

#### 5. `Simulation` (simulation.py)
Orchestrates market interaction and data collection:

**Key Functions:**
- Run multi-period market simulation
- Track prices, profits, and market shares
- Visualize market dynamics
- Calculate period-by-period economic interactions

## Simulation Dynamics

### Market Share Calculation
Market share is determined by a logistic function of price difference:
- Captures non-linear consumer decision-making
- Smooth transition between competing firms
- Mathematically represented as: 
  share_a = 1 / (1 + exp(-price_sensitivity * price_diff))

### Demand Model
Linear demand function:
Q = market_size * (1 - price/max_price)
- Demand decreases as price increases
- Total market size acts as a scaling factor

## Economic Insights

### Pricing Strategies
- Dynamic price adjustment
- Competitive underbidding
- Maintaining profitability above marginal cost

### Market Equilibrium
The simulation explores how firms:
- Respond to competitor pricing
- Maintain profit margins
- Adapt to market conditions

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize market components
cost = Cost(marginal_cost=10)
market = Market(market_size=1000, max_price=50, price_sensitivity=2.0)
company_a = Company(name='A', cost=cost, initial_price=45)
company_b = Company(name='B', cost=cost, initial_price=40)

# Create strategies
strategy_a = BertrandUnderbiddingStrategy()
strategy_b = BertrandUnderbiddingStrategy()

# Run simulation
simulation = Simulation(market, company_a, company_b, strategy_a, strategy_b, num_periods=50)
prices_a, prices_b, profits_a, profits_b, shares_a, shares_b = simulation.run()
simulation.plot_results(prices_a, prices_b, profits_a, profits_b, shares_a, shares_b)
```
